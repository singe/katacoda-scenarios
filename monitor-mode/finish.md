Thanks for playing.

In this course, I tried to show you how to put a wireless device into monitor mode, capture nearby wifi traffic, crack WPA handshakes and analyse wifi packet captures. I hope you learned something.

If you liked the course, please let me know either on Twitter [@singe](https://twitter.com/singe) or via [e-mail](mailto:research@sensepost.com) to encourage me to create more, make corrections, or try out your new idea :)

I maintain a list of wifi hacking tools at [w1f1.net](https://w1f1.net) and my company, [SensePost](https://sensepost.com/) has been running commercial training on all sorts of hacking topics, including wifi, at places like [BlackHat](https://blackhat.com/) for years. Please [Contact Us](https://sensepost.com/contact/) if you'd like to attend one of our training or run one at your company.
